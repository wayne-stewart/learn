# Blind Turtle
 The goal of this software is to provide means for securing private information like credit cards and passwords. You can choose to save the files locally or choose your own store that can be synced across devices. This software is built with the principle of ZERO server trust. The server has no capability to unencrypt your document. If you lose your password, there is no possibility of data recovery ( outside possibly some professional cryptanalysis services. )
