    <label>Description:</label>
    <p class="indent">
        The goal of this software is to provide means for securing private information
        like credit cards and passwords. You can choose to save the files locally or
        choose your own store that can be synced across devices. This software is built 
        with the principle of ZERO server trust. The server has no capability to 
        decrypt your document. If you lose your password, there is no possibility 
        of data recovery ( outside possibly some professional cryptanalysis services. )

    The master password will be used to encrypt your data and your local configuration. You can leave it
    blank, but then anyone will be able to read your private data.
    <span class="red">If you lose your master password, your data will be unretrievable.</span> Make sure your 
    Master Password is long, unique, strong, and memorable.
</template>
<template id="view_savelocal_text">
    If no file name is specified a default will be used.<br />
    While a password is not required, it is HIGHLY recommended you use a strong one.
